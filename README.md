# BookScrabble

Hello and welcome to our wonderfull BookScrabble Project. 
We are a team of three student developers that are making this project as part of our computer science degree studies in the course ״Advanced software development״.

We are all eager to learn and gain experience in the field, so we have decided that each member of the team will get to experience development in all fields. So each member will be a part in designing and developing the model, view-model and view.

Inorder to finish this project in time we have made this charming gantt chart that shows the tasks division:
